Movie Recommender System using Llama3 and FAISS
Welcome to the Movie Recommender System project! This repository showcases an advanced movie recommendation engine built using the Llama3 Large Language Model (LLM) and Facebook AI Similarity Search (FAISS). The project leverages the Netflix_titles dataset from Kaggle to provide personalized movie recommendations.

Features
Integration of Llama3: Utilizes the Llama3 LLM to generate high-quality embeddings and understand user preferences for accurate recommendations.
FAISS for Similarity Search: Employs FAISS for fast and efficient similarity search, ensuring quick and relevant movie recommendations.
API Requests Handling: Utilizes the requests library to manage API calls seamlessly.
Data Source: Based on the comprehensive Netflix_titles dataset from Kaggle.
Challenges
Running the LLM Locally: Training the LLM locally required around 12 hours, leading to significant device lagging and performance issues.
Data Processing: Handling and preprocessing a large dataset was crucial for efficient training and querying.
Usage
Preprocess the Data: Run the data preprocessing script to prepare the Netflix_titles dataset.
Train the Model: Execute the training script to generate embeddings using Llama3.
Build the Index: Use FAISS to build the similarity search index.
Get Recommendations: Run the recommendation script to get personalized movie recommendations based on user input.
